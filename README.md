"Breakout"

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## V5

- [x] Player Controller
- [x] NPCs
- [x] Enemies
- [x] Keys
- [x] Doors (Locked/Unlocked)
- [x] Local player inventory
- [ ] Box inventory

What needs fixing:
* BoxInteraction.cs will not transfer objects correctly to the inventory and back, this relates to ItemSlotDragDropHandler.cs, InventoryController.cs and InventoryUI.cs
